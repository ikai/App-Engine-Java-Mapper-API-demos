Demonstrates a bunch of useful Mappers.

The Mapper library can be found here:

http://code.google.com/p/appengine-mapreduce

This project includes sample code for using the Java version of this
library. Code samples include:

- Changing all Strings to lowercase across all Entities
- Changing all Strings to lowercase across all Entities using a mutation pool (more efficient)
- Deleting all Entities of a given Kind
- Counting all the words across all Entities, then using a callback URL to save them

More examples will come soon as well as a detailed blog post.
